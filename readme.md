# IME: iMessage Exporter

An iMessage exporter. I made this cause I was pissed off because all of the tools I tried to use either didn't work or were paid.

## How to use

1. Create a backup with iTunes
2. Run extractor.py
3. Open the HTML file in your browser
4. Enjoy your exported messages

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
